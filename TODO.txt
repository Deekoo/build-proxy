In addition to --allow-write, the cloneserver has an undocumented
--allow-update option.  This may well be broken (old notes suggest I didn't
quite get it right for svn.  Using svnrdump to get a clone of a Subversion
repo in a reasonable timeframe leads to the svn repos being in a state where
svnsync gets congused); it should probably be fixed, to make it easier to
add changes to a mirror.

Wget mirror could support ftp.

Some svn and git repository-copy operations may currently put them in the
mirror even when the download is interrupted, which will probably break
attempts to check them out from the mirror.  (Some of those have been fixed,
but I haven't exhaustively checked to see if they all are.)

The cloneserver is strictly single-threaded and only handles a single
connection at a time.  This will probably screw up parallelized builds
(e.g. 'make -j9' or the like)

This could be modified to allow the cloneserver and/or build proxy to live
on a different machine than the actual build process, thus mitigating local
root vulnerabilities.

This could be modified a bit more to allow for the creation of local in-mesh
persistent cachemirrors of chunks of the more-static parts of the web - though
that's got its own caveats, since the most useful thing I can think of to
do with such mirrors would be stuff like 'local mirror of all the Debian
security updates'.
