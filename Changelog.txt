[ 0.2.1+ ]
* HTTP repo cloning warning now only displayed if actually trying to clone
an HTTP repo.
* cloneserver now closes connections after sending the ok/fail message.
* git stub now tries to get the mirror to clone things.
* Cloneserver now logs attempts.
* Wget mirrorer now accepts / in URLs
* prep-cloneserver script added.
* cloneserver: wget mirroring works.
* cloneserver: wget mirroring now uses preexisting files if one exists.
* Build script: wget mirroring works.
* Improved logging.
[ 0.2.3 ]
* svn mirroring now distinguishes between http and svn protocol mirrors.
* svn mirroring now works correctly when mirroring something that's a path
under the full repository - e.g. http://svn.nomi.cz/svn/isteve/hotplug2 is
actually in the http://svn.nomi.cz/svn/isteve/ repo.  Symlinks from
(mirror root)/svn-(protocol)-roots/(domain)/(url path) to the actual mirror
directory are created when mirroring completes.
* A number of errors and warnings now say which app they're from.
[ 0.2.4 ]
* _ accepted in svn clone urls
* Cloneserver scripts now set umask 022.
* Now uses svnrdump for Subversion mirroring, which seems to be much much
faster.
[ 0.2.5 ]
* hackish fixup for OpenWRT subversion sync broken by fast mirror, so removed.
* svnrdump doesn't work with HTTP svn mirrors, so use svnsync when cloning
non-svn:// svn URLs.
* git now mirrors to per-protocol paths.
* Can now clone git https repos.
[ 0.3 ]
* Documentation clarifications.
